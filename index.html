  <h2>About Us</h2>

  <p>The Weill Cornell Data Science Club is a student organization focused on
    encouraging the exploration the application of data science both inside
    and outside the medical realm. The goals for this club also include fostering
    cross-institutional interaction and helping members grow personally and professionally

      in both Weill Cornell Campus and the Ithaca campus as well as mini lessons
      to help further oneâ€™s skillsets in technical as well as professional development.</p>
